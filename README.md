See below for technical details of this project. 






















Goal: Investegate propogation of synthetic voice based transmission systems over FM, transmitted on common frequencies. 

Location: Australia, generally NSW

FAQ: 

Q: Is this really encrypted?
A: No. the decryption pads are always published on this public site before or soon after transmission. 

Q: why are you using one time pads?
A: it is important that we use random-seeming sequences to avoid statistical bias. human language has clear patterns and if other methods (i.e. encoding ASCII character numbers) were used, the data would be heavily biased. We use publicly avaliable RNG sourced from https://qrng.anu.edu.au/ to enable true randomness, and publish decryption pads as there is (frequently) a standardised message, and because one-time-pads increase community engagement and therefore data gathered

Q: is this a real numbers station?
A: Yes in the sense that this is a numbers station. No, we are not transmitting hidden codes out to spies. 

Q: what mode will you tx on?
A: at this stage, FM cw (for ident and this repo link) and FM voice (for test data). 

Q: what bands will you tx on?
A: at this stage, mostly 2m. may tx on 70cm

Q: Will you disclose tx time or band?
A: sometimes! sometimes data on collection rate is important to us, and we may choose not to annouce tx band, time, or exact frequency, depending. if announced, it will be published here.

Q: What data will you publish?
A: clean recording of tx'd audio, tx time, approx TX location, band.

Q: What data would you like to collect from listeners:
A: in order of difficulty: Signal report, your rx location transcript, recording of rx'd stream

Q: what's with the themeing? 
A: having a theme increases engagement and therefore data collected. we appreciate the writing at https://ocm.icu/ and though it would be an appropiate theme. there is no link between this project and https://ocm.icu/

Q: who are you?
A: [REDACTED]
